        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
        <p>
            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 Abs.1 of the TMG 
            (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. However, pursuant to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or 
            stored external information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard 
            is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove 
            this content immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
        <p>
            Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot 
            assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the 
            content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content 
            was not recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p>
            A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If we become 
            aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Copyright</h2>
        <p>
            The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. The duplication, editing, 
            distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or 
            creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, 
            third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we request that you 
            notify us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (such as name, address, 
            or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, where possible. This data will not be 
            passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., when communicating via email) may have security 
            vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data against unauthorized access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of the contact data published within the scope of the legal notice obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending 
            unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of these pages expressly reserve 
            the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited promotional information, such as spam emails.
